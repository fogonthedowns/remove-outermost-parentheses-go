Remove Outermost Parentheses

Input: "(()())(())"
Output: "()()()"
Explanation: 
The input string is "(()())(())", with primitive decomposition "(()())" + "(())".
After removing outer parentheses of each part, this is "()()" + "()" = "()()()".

0. Loop over input string
1. Build an output string
3. Use a stack push if empty
  - if the top of the stack is an open parentheses and the current character is a closed parentheses
    - pop off of the stack
  - otherwise append to the stack

4. If the stack is empty
  - remove the first and last character from the stack
    - first is determined by the starting offset
  - set the offset (staring point) as the current len of the output
